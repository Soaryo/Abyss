# Essence of calculus
## the core ideas of calculus
1. Integrals
2. Derivatives
3. The fact that they are opposites

### Transitioned from something approximate to something precise.

the problem that could be approximated with the sum of many small numbers.

Hard problem => Sum of many small values => Area under a graph.

A(x),the area under the graph of x^2. So a function A(x) is called an “integral” of x^2.

### how to find the integral function A(x)?
dA: a tiny difference in area.

Integral’s property: dA/dx = f(x).Gets better as dx -> 0.

This ratio dA/dx is called the “derivative of A”

### Integral and Derivative

The derivative of a function(A(x)) for the area under a graph gives you back the function defining the graph itself.
- the Integral of f(x) is A(x).
- the Derivative of A(x) is f(x). 
- The derivative of f(x) is the slope of a line tangent.

## The paradox of the derivative
Derivative: it’s a measure of how sensitive a function is to small changes on its input.

### Instantaneous rate of change?
Change is something that happens between separate points in time. It requires multiple points in time.

Instantaneous is one point in time.

### How does velocity depend on the distance vs. time function.
 Velocity is the distance traveled per unit time. Computing speed during very small amounts of time.
 
 ### Derivative: tiny change!
 The ratio of dA/dx is the slope of a line passing through two separate points on the graph. As dx approaches 0, derivative is equal to the slope of a line tangent to the graph at a single point.
 
 dx is not “infinitely small”!
 dx is not 0.
 
 The best constant approximation for a rate of change around a point.
 
 The derivative of f(x) is the slope of a line tangent.

##  Understand derivative of complicated combinations
### Sum rule
The derivative of the sum of two functions, is the sum of the derivatives.

### Product rule
Deal with a product of two things => Deal Area. 
Thinking of this is a adjustable box.

f(x)= ** = Area.
  
”Left d(Right)+ Right d(Left)”

### Chain rule
(d/dx)(g(h(x))= (dg/dh)(dh/dx) = dg/dx

## Derivative of Exponential
Rate of change over one full day: 2^(t+1)- 2^t = 2^t.

---

Tiny change:
The derivative of e^x: e^x.

The number 2 can also be written as e^ln(2), 2 = e^ln(2).
=> 2^t = e^ln(2)t.
=> d(2^t) = e^ln(2)t * ln(2) = ln(2)*2^t


## Implicit differentiation
Implicit curve: x^2 + y^2 = 5^2. The set of all points (x,y) that satisfy some property written in terms of the two variables x and y.

Implicit differentiation: 2xdx + 2ydy = 0.

S(x,y) = x^2+ y^2
dS = 2xdx + 2ydy.
Tiny change: any tiny step in any direction on the day-plane.
How much does the value of S change?
dS = 0. Keep on this Curve.

Example:
Implicit curve: y = lnx, Slope = dy/dx = d(ln(x)) /dx
e^y = x
e^y * dy = dx
dy/dx = 1/e^y = 1/x

The derivative of ln(x) is 1/x !  

### Multivariable calculus
Consider function with multiple inputs, how they change as you tweak those multiple inputs.

## Limit
> Calculus required continuity, and continuity was supposed require the infinitely little; but nobody could discover what the infinitely little might be.  — Bertrand Russell.
